description:
The Knowledge-Based System (KBS) for AIE Course Registration Advising is designed to assist students in selecting courses for registration, tailored to the Artificial
Intelligence Engineering track. The system analyzes a students semester, Cumulative Grade
Point Average (CGPA), total credits passed, and course history (passed and failed courses)
to recommend a course load that complies with university policies, such as credit limits,
prerequisites, and co-requisites. It features a user-friendly Streamlit interface for students
to input data and view recommendations, an admin interface for managing course data,
and a login system to differentiate user roles.
The systems functionality includes:
• Recommending core, university requirement, and elective courses based on student
inputs and university policies.
• Prioritizing retaking failed courses and ensuring prerequisite and co-requisite requirements are met.
• Calculating total recommended credit hours and providing explanations for recommendations and exclusions.
• Allowing administrators to add, edit, delete, and view course data in the knowledge
base.
The domain modeled is the AIE course registration process, focusing on the Artificial
Intelligence Science track, ensuring compliance with academic policies and supporting
students in making informed registration decisions.
